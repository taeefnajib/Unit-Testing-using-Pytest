# Unit Testing Using Pytest

Pytest is a testing framework that allows you to write small, readable tests in Python, and can scale to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

In order to use pytest, we need to install it first with the following command:

```python
pip install -U pytest
```
To use the examples in this repo, you should also install `pandas`
```
pip install pandas
```
